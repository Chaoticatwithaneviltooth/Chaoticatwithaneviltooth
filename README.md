ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Keerthana.
ğŸ§¬ Iâ€™m an aspiring Bioinformatician in training.
I love working with data and visualising trends ğŸ“ˆ and I hope to eventually break into the tech space.

ğŸ“– Iâ€™m currently doing a graduate programme in Precision Health and Medicine, where I've been learning a lot about Machine Learning and Deep Learning frameworks ğŸ§ .
I hope to document my journey here and perhaps meet like-minded people.
Thanks for dropping by, and stay tuned~
